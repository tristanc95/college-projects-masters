This class involved Data Modeling via SQL Queries and data. 

For the Term Project, I had to create and design a database to be used in MySQL. My project was involved around a false company that I made up during my bachelors called MediaBox. This is a fake movie company that sells blu-rays, dvds, and all sorts of odd physical media. 

On top of curating the MySQL database, I came across the problem of having to add all my data manually which I knew was going to be a hassle. To help circumvent this, I was able to use my brief stint with Python (plus the help of the internet) to create small scripts that created fake information for my customers, employees, salaries and more. I've included them in here as well, though I would like to note that they are extremely basic and simple and could be easily made way better.

Big thanks to the Faker library (for helping curate and create all of the random and fake information) and IMDBpy (to grab a random set of movies that fit my database criteria)
